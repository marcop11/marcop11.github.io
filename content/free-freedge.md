# Freedge Iceland — Community Fridges Across the Country

🌍 **Freedge Iceland (Frískápur)** is a grassroots community project that reduces food waste, increases food access, and strengthens local communities across Iceland.  

It’s a simple idea:  
**give what you don’t need, take what you need.**  
Anyone can contribute. Anyone can take. Everything is free.

## 🧊 What Is a Freedge?

A **Freedge (Frískápur)** is a public refrigerator placed in a neighborhood so people can share surplus food instead of throwing it away.  

Freedges in Iceland serve many purposes:

- 🥫 Reduce food waste  
- 🥦 Share surplus food so it doesn’t end up in landfills  
- 💛 Support those who need food  
- 🤝 Strengthen local community ties  
- 🌍 Promote sustainable living  

The movement in Iceland is volunteer-driven, growing, and deeply community-oriented.

## 🤲 How It Works

Freedge Iceland follows three simple principles:

### **1. Give Food**
Leave food you don’t need anymore — vegetables, packaged goods, properly labeled leftovers, bread, fruit, etc.

### **2. Take Freely**
Anyone can take food from a Freedge **at any time**, no questions asked.

### **3. Share & Care**
Tell your neighbors, contribute what you can, and help keep the fridge clean and welcoming.

## 📜 Guidelines (Iceland Edition)

Freedge Iceland maintains clear, safety-focused guidelines:

1. Everything inside is **free**.
2. You take food at your own responsibility — use your senses and common sense.
3. Only leave food **you would eat yourself**.
4. Leave the fridge **cleaner than you found it**.
5. Don’t take everything — it’s about sharing.
6. Homemade food must be labeled with **date + ingredients** (allergens).
7. No expired products (unless marked *“best before”*).
8. **No** raw meat, fish, or egg products.
9. **No** open cans or jars.
10. **No alcohol**.
11. If you bring bread — place it in a sealed bag or into the freezer.
