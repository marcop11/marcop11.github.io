## 🚗 Roundabouts in Iceland

For Day 24, the theme was **“Only Circular Shapes,”** and what better circular feature to map than **roundabouts**?

According to OpenStreetMap data, Iceland has **289 roundabouts**. They are an essential part of traffic flow across the country, shaping how people move through both busy urban areas and quieter rural towns.

### 📊 How are they distributed?

A few municipalities stand out:

- **Reykjavík** leads with **73 roundabouts**
- **Hafnarfjörður** follows with **43**
- **Kópavogur** comes next with **41**

Among the smaller municipalities, **Vogar** is particularly unique:  
with just **8 roundabouts**, it has the **highest number of roundabouts per person** in Iceland — about **0.53% of the population per roundabout**.

These differences highlight how each municipality grows and organizes its road network, from dense urban centers to coastal villages.

## 🗺 What the Map Shows

This visualization highlights:

- A **pie chart** showing roundabout distribution by municipality  
- A selection of **notable roundabouts**, including scenic or unusual ones  
- A country-wide view of how circular traffic features shape local infrastructure  

It’s a fun way to explore Iceland’s transportation patterns through a simple geometric lens.

Roundabouts may seem like simple circles, but they reveal a lot about how Icelandic towns are designed and connected.
