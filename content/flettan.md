# Fléttan — Predicting Soil Erosion in the Arctic

**Fléttan** is an Icelandic startup developing a next-generation predictive system for **soil erosion risk in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions**.  
I am proud to be the **co-founder and CTO**, working alongside a multidisciplinary team driven by environmental protection, science, and cutting-edge technology.

Our mission is simple:  
**use satellite data + machine learning to protect fragile northern landscapes.**

## 🌍 Why Fléttan Exists

Arctic ecosystems are changing rapidly — warmer winters, more intense storms, and human pressures put soil at increasing risk of erosion. Traditional monitoring methods are often slow, local, or manually processed.

Fléttan was created to solve this:

### **A predictive algorithm for the Arctic**
Fléttan has developed a **machine-learning-powered soil erosion risk model** that:

- Uses **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery**  
- Calibrates satellite data with **historical ground truth**  
- Integrates **environmental variables** relevant to Arctic landscapes  
- Applies **state-of-the-art ML classification**  
- Generates **high-resolution erosion risk maps**  
- Updates continuously as new data arrives  

The result is a **more accurate, data-driven understanding of erosion risk** than any existing Arctic-specific model.

## 🛰 Interactive Soil Erosion Map of Iceland

Our latest **alpha version** of the national soil erosion map is available on Ellipsis Drive.  
This early preview shows the potential of our approach and the scale of Iceland’s erosion challenges.

## 🌱 Looking Ahead

Fléttan is still at the beginning of its journey — but the momentum is strong.  
Our long-term vision is a **full-scale environmental intelligence platform** for the northern world, providing:

- real-time erosion alerts  
- long-term land degradation analyses  
- decision-support tools for governments & stakeholders  
- accessible visual maps for the public  

We believe every pixel tells a story — and, with the right tools, we can help protect the landscapes that define Iceland and the Arctic.
