# Exploring OpenStreetMap in 3D — A Playable Map for Day 20

**Day 20 of the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) 2024**  
Created for **Náttúrufræðistofnun**

| [🎮 Play the Game](https://m-lmi.github.io/30DayMapChallenge/Day-20/index.html) |
|--------------------------------------------|

For Day 20, the theme is **OpenStreetMap** — and instead of a traditional static visualization, I created something more playful:  
a **3D exploration game** built on top of OSM Buildings.

This small game invites you to navigate a three-dimensional world generated entirely from OpenStreetMap data. The goal is simple:  
**look around, explore, and try to guess where you are!**

## 🏙 A 3D World Built from OpenStreetMap

This map uses the **OSM Buildings** framework to extrude real buildings into 3D.  
You can:

- **Zoom in and out** to change perspective  
- **Rotate and pan** to explore your surroundings  
- **Search for clues** to identify your location  
- **Guess where you are** based on landmarks, density, or terrain  

It’s a lightweight geography game — a fun way to understand what OSM's 3D data actually looks like.

## 🕹 How to Play

1. **Move around** using your mouse or trackpad  
2. **Observe the buildings** — their shapes, heights, and layout  
3. **Look for patterns** that reveal the area  
4. **Take a guess** about where you’ve landed  
5. **Reload** to try different positions  

The entire experience is browser-based and requires no installation.

## 💡 Why 3D?

OpenStreetMap is best known for its 2D data, but its 3D ecosystem has grown significantly.  
Tools like **OSM Buildings** turn simple building footprints into a semi-realistic 3D cityscape — ideal for:

- Urban visualization  
- Education and teaching  
- Interactive maps  
- Games and playful experiments  
- Understanding OSM’s structure beyond flat maps  

This Day 20 entry shows how easy it is to take OSM data and turn it into something immersive.

## ⚠️ Notes & Performance

- A **fast internet connection** helps load 3D tiles more smoothly  
- Works best on **desktop browsers**  
- Not optimized for mobile devices

Explore the 3D world, look around, and see if you can figure out where you are.  
It's a simple project — but a great reminder of how rich and creative the OpenStreetMap ecosystem can be.
