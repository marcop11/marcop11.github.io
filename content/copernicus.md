# Copernicus Iceland — Earth Observation for a Changing Land

**Website:** [https://www.copernicus.gis.is/](https://copernicus.gis.is/homepage/)

Iceland is home to some of the most dramatic and dynamic landscapes on Earth: glaciers, volcanoes, rugged coastlines, shifting soils, and fragile Arctic ecosystems.  
As Iceland’s delegate to the Copernicus Configuration Committee — and past lead of the FPCUP project — I believe strongly in the power of Earth-observation data to inform science, conservation, policy, and sustainable development. That’s why I’m proud to highlight **Copernicus Iceland**, a national portal for satellite and geospatial data tailored to Iceland’s environment.

## 🌐 What is Copernicus Iceland?

Copernicus Iceland is a national-level implementation of the broader European Copernicus Programme, adapted to the unique geography and challenges of Iceland. Through this portal, users can access:

- Satellite imagery (optical, radar) covering Iceland and surrounding regions  
- Processed and pre-prepared geospatial products suitable for environmental monitoring — glaciers, land deformation, land cover, coastal erosion, soil / erosion risk, hazard zones  
- Historical time series data, enabling change detection and long-term studies  
- Tools to download raw and processed data for research, planning, GIS analysis  

The portal serves researchers, policy-makers, environmental agencies, NGOs, land managers — and anyone who cares about Iceland’s landscapes.

## 🔎 Why It Matters for Iceland

- **Glacial retreat & climate change:** With retreating glaciers and shifting coastlines, satellite monitoring helps track ice loss, elevation changes, and emerging hazard zones.  
- **Volcanic activity & natural hazards:** Iceland’s active geology — volcanoes, earthquakes — demands up-to-date, high-resolution data. Copernicus helps map risk zones, monitor land deformation, and support early warning.  
- **Land use, soil erosion & environmental protection:** As part of my work with the Fléttan project, we combine soil-erosion modelling with remote sensing data. Copernicus supplies the raw and processed data needed for robust machine-learning and analysis.  
- **Sustainable development & planning:** For infrastructure, tourism, conservation — Copernicus gives planners real data to base decisions on, reducing guesswork and increasing resilience.  

## 🛠 My Role: Bridge Between Data and Action

As Iceland’s delegate to the Copernicus Configuration Committee, and lead of the FPCUP project, I act as a bridge among:

- national stakeholders (government, environment agencies)  
- scientific researchers and modelers  
- international Copernicus community  

My goals:

- Ensure Iceland’s unique geographical and ecological needs are represented in Copernicus’s data products.  
- Promote open access and transparency, so satellite data benefits research, public policy, and community-level action.

## 🎯 Why I Believe in Copernicus Iceland

Iceland’s landscapes are more than beautiful — they’re fragile, vital, and constantly shifting. With Copernicus Iceland, we have a chance to:

- Understand long-term environmental changes  
- Make informed decisions for conservation, land use, and hazard mitigation  
- Empower researchers, policymakers and communities with data-driven insights  

If you care about Iceland’s future — from glaciers to highlands, from coastlines to ecosystems — I encourage you to explore Copernicus Iceland, download data, and get involved. The view from space might just help protect what we love on the ground.
